QUEUES

Queues are a type of Data Structure which follow the FIFO principle (First-in-First-Out). Every Queue is characterized by two parameters called the "front" which is responsible for representing the oldest element in the current queue and "rear" which is responsible for representing the latest element added to the queue.

ENQUEUE Operation - Represents the insertion operation in a queue structure. A new element is always added at the end of the Queue. "rear" is updated after the addition.

DEQUEUE Operation - Represents the deletion operation in a queue structure. The first element is always removed in this DEQUEUE operation. "front" is updated after the deletion.
